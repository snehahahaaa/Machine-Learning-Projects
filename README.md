# Machine-Learning-Projects
A learning-oriented machine learning repository showcasing practical projects built from scratch. It demonstrates the complete ML pipeline—from data cleaning and correlation analysis to model training, prediction, and performance evaluation—designed for beginners exploring applied machine learning.

This repository contains machine learning projects built using **Python**.  
The goal of this repository is to practice and understand machine learning concepts through hands-on projects.

## What this repository includes
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis and visualization
- Machine learning models (Regression)
- Model training and testing
- Model evaluation (R² score, RMSE)
- Basic visualizations using plots

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Dataset Usage (Google Colab)
The datasets used in these projects are uploaded directly into **Google Colab**.

Steps followed:
1. Open the project notebook in Google Colab
2. Use the **Files** panel (left sidebar) to upload the dataset file (CSV)
3. Load the dataset in the notebook using pandas, for example:
   #```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.read_csv('dataset_name.csv')
